# About this site

Hi, this is the website of Máté Kukri. I use this as site as a platform to post
about programming, cybersecurity and occasionally other things.

## About me

I was born in Hungary and lived the first 19 years of my life there. I've been
tinkering with computers ever since I had my first PC in 2010. Playing games and
breaking Windows got boring after a while, and I started learning programming in
2012. After finishing secondary school in 2019 I moved to the United Kingdom to
study Computing Science at the University of Glasgow.

I am a comittee member of the <a href="https://gusecurity.github.io">GUSEC</a>
(Glasgow University Security Society). We are a student run society.
Our goal is getting more people interested in cybersecurity at the
university and learning more about the topic together.
